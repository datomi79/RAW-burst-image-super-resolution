Official repository for the EagleSnap Competition 2023: RAW Burst Image Super Resolution

## Introduction
EagleSnap Super-Resolution Competition is a machine learning challenge aimed at enhancing RAW images. The goal of this competition is to generate a denoised, demosaicked, higher-resolution image, given a RAW burst as input. The competition has two tracks, namely Track 1: Maximize quality based on a simple metric and Track 2: Minimize compute time with quality requirement. The top ranked participants in each track will be awarded and all participants are invited to submit a report describing their solution.

## Description

Given multiple noisy RAW images of a scene, the task in EagleSnap Super-Resolution Competition is to predict a denoised higher-resolution RGB image by combining information from the multiple input frames. Concretely, the participants will have a burst sequence containing 14 images to train their model.
